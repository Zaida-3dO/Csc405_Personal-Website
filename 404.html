        <p>Sorry but the page you are trying to reach does not exist on our server. There is a 2% chance it's a server problem, you could try refreshing to fix that, else, it turns out I simply didn't design the page. Not cuz i was lazy, but because the assignment was to design at least 3 Pages.....<br>And Man cannot come and go and kill himself. </p>
